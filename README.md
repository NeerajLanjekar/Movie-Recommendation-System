# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project report presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a movie
recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques
with a search box. The goal of the system is to provide personalized movie
recommendations to users based on their preferences and selected movies. The project
incorporates a dataset of movies, collaborative filtering algorithms, and external APIs to fetch
additional movie details and posters. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the system in generating accurate and diverse recommendations.
